    Question 1 [20 points]

I am interested in the average attendance at each World Cup Soccer game dependent on the host country.
This data is available as WorldCup.xlsx within the Final Exam assignment page.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(cowplot)
```

a. Load the data frame. Be sure to load the correct sheet and skip any uninformative lines.
```{r}
worldCup_df <- data.frame(read_excel(path = "data-raw/WorldCup-1.xlsx", 
                                     sheet = "worldcup", range = 'A3:I29'))
```


b. Clean the data you have loaded to include the following columns: Year, Hosts, Matches,
Totalattendance, and Averageattendance. You will either need to make your own column names
or properly clean the strings given for the column names (they contain special characters that should not
be retained). Remove commas from numerical values and ensure the Attendance columns are properly
formatted as numerical data. Keep the Year variable as strings. Remove data related to any World Cups
that have not occurred and the Overall statistics. Do all cleaning within R. Do not edit the excel file.
```{r}
worldcup_cleaned <- worldCup_df %>%
  select(Year, Hosts, Matches, Totalattendance, Averageattendance) %>%
  mutate(Year = str_remove(Year, pattern = '\\[n 1]')) %>%
  mutate(Totalattendance = as.numeric(str_remove_all(Totalattendance, pattern = ','))) %>%
  mutate(Averageattendance = as.numeric(str_remove_all(Averageattendance, pattern = ','))) %>%
  filter(Year != 'Overall') %>%
  filter(as.numeric(Year) >= 1930 & as.numeric(Year) <= 2022)
```

c. Some countries have hosted multiple World Cups. Make unique identifiers for each World Cup by pasting
together the Host and Year. Create a new column named worldcup that contains these unique identifiers
(i.e. Uruguay1930). Remove any remaining spaces in the worldcup names. Remove the Hosts and Year
columns when finished.
```{r}
worldcup_cleaned = worldcup_cleaned %>%
  mutate(worldcup = paste(Hosts, Year, sep = "")) %>%
  mutate(worldcup = str_remove_all(worldcup, pattern = " ")) %>%
  select(-Year, -Hosts)
```


d. Display the first ten rows of the data frame using the head command.
```{r}
head(worldcup_cleaned, n = 10)
```

e. Display the structure of the data frame.
```{r}
str(worldcup_cleaned)
```

f. Create a column graph displaying worldcup against the Averageattendance. Arrange the graph such
that the bars are ordered by average attendance. Make sure the worldcup identifiers are visible on the graph
(i.e. you can read them). Clean up the axes such that they read World Cup Host and Year and Average
Attendance.
```{r}
ggplot(worldcup_cleaned) +
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(worldcup, Averageattendance), y = Averageattendance), 
           fill='goldenrod1') +
  labs(title = 'World Cup Attendance', 
       x = 'World Cup Host and Year', 
       y = 'Average Attendance') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

    Question 2 [20 points]
    
Considering the average attendance at World Cup matches got me thinking about world population. I was
able to find an excel file from the United Nations tracking estimated populations for all countries that are
part of the UN. This data is available as World_Populations.xlsx within the Final Exam assignment page.

a. Load the data frame the ESTIMATES tab. Be sure to skip any uninformative lines.
```{r}
worldPop_df <- data.frame(read_excel(path = "data-raw/World_Population.xlsx", 
                                     sheet = "ESTIMATES", range = 'A17:BZ306'))
```

b. Using regular expressions and tidyverse commands, clean the data to include only population information
from 1950 to 2020 for all countries. Remove all extra information regarding regions, subregions, income,
etc. Retain only the Country Name and population estimates for years 1950 to 2020. Name this data.frame
WorldPopulation. Do all the data cleaning within R. Do not edit the excel file.
```{r}
WorldPopulation = worldPop_df %>%
  mutate(Country = Region..subregion..country.or.area..) %>%
  filter(Type == "Country/Area") %>%
  select(Country, starts_with("X")) %>%
  pivot_longer(X1950:X2020,
               names_to = "Year",
               values_to = "Population") %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_sub(Year, start = 2))) %>%
  mutate(Year = make_date(year = Year)) %>%
  mutate(Population = as.integer(Population))
  
```

c. Create a single panel graph displaying Year against Population for Brazil, Mexico, and Italy. Use
different colors for the three countries. Properly label the axes.
```{r, fig.width= 8}
threeCountries <- WorldPopulation %>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Italy", "Mexico", "Brazil"))

countriesPlotted <- ggplot(threeCountries, aes(x=Year, y = Population, group = Country, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Population Growth Over Time",
       y = "Population (Thousands)",
       color = "Country")

countriesPlotted
```

d. Apply a theme of your choice to the graph in part c..
```{r}
countriesPlotted +
  theme_classic()
```
    Question 3 [25 points]
    
I want to be able to easily graph any of the UN countries given in the Excel file for Question 2. My preference
would be to just enter a country name and obtain a graph of the population from 1950 to 2020.

a. Produce a function that is hard coded to use the data.frame produced in Question 2 part b. The function
should take as input a country name (as a string) and return the population against year graph for that
country. Name this function CountryPopulation.
Hint: Wrap up what you did Question 2c into a function that returns an object that is a ggplot. Remove any
options for color. Add an option for title that uses the string that is input. This should produce a black and
white graph with the name of the country at the top.
```{r}
CountryPopulation <- function(country){
  country <- as.character(country)
  countryFilt <- WorldPopulation %>%
    filter(Country == country)
  ggplot(countryFilt, aes(x=Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = country,
       y = "Population (Thousands)") +
  theme_bw()
}
```

b. Produce graphs for United States of America, Russian Federation, China, and United Kingdom
using your function. You may store these as objects to be used in part c.. Display at least one of the four
graphs produced.
```{r}
usGraph <- CountryPopulation("United States of America")
usGraph
```
```{r}
rfGraph <- CountryPopulation("Russian Federation")
rfGraph
```
```{r}
chinaGraph <- CountryPopulation("China")
chinaGraph
```
```{r}
ukGraph <- CountryPopulation("United Kingdom")
ukGraph
```

c. Using cowplot or ‘patchwork’ combine the four graphs from part b. into a single panel.
```{r}
plot_grid(usGraph, rfGraph, chinaGraph, ukGraph)
```
    Question 4 [25 points]

This problem should be listed on the submitted PDF and provide a link to your GitHub package.
We now have some really interesting population data and a function that allows us to view any population
graphs of UN countries. Let’s package this up with some additional troubleshooting. Follow the steps below
and ensure you upload the package to GitHub.

a. Initialize a new package named YourLastNameWorldPopulation.

b. Add the World_Population.xlsx file to the data-raw folder.

c. Using your cleaning script from Question 2b, add the cleaned version of the world population data to
the package. Call this data set WorldPopulation, ensure it gives only the columns as given in Question
2b. Make sure to document the data set.

d. Add to your package the function CountryPopulation. Be sure to include a description for the documentation.

e. Add a unit test to the :package to check if a country name entered is in the cleaned data file
WorldPopulation. If the country is not present, then the function CountryPopulation should return an
error.

f. Compile your package and upload to GitHub within the repository YourLastNameWorldPopulation. As
a solution to Question 4, provide the link to your GitHub package.
